Time-offset-channels. 
Some sites list channels that differ only from another through a time difference. Instead of grabbing the epg separately it is possible to just copy and time-shift the 'source' channel with a special channel specification in Webgrab++.config.xml
For that use the attributes same_as  and  offset as follows:
Example of time-offset-channels :
<channel update="i" site="laguiatv.com" site_id="Canal +" xmltv_id="Canal +">Canal +</channel>
<channel same_as="Canal +" offset="2" xmltv_id="Canal + 2">Canal + 2</channel>
The source channel (here ="Canal +") must always be listed before the time-offset-channel (here "Canal + 2") The offset can also be negative like offset="-1"
