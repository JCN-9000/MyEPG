// Small program that replaces the time offset part of the start and stop time in an xmltv file
// by the corrected time string for the local timezone
// Intended use together with the MediaPortal xmltv importer that seems not to use the time offset

use : 
- place wg2mp.bat and wg2mp.exe in the same folder
- edit wg2mp.bat to specify the input and output file 
- save wg2mp.bat in the same folder as wg2mp.exe
- run wg2mp.bat

The output xmltv file should be suitable to be imported in Media Portal
