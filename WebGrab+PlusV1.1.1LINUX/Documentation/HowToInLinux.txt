How to install and execute WebGrab+Plus in Linux by means of mono.
by Alberto Miguel, 06/07/2012

WebGrab+Plus have been tested with MONO 2.10.8 and 2.11.

Installation:

Create a 'homefolder' for WebGrab+Plus, eg "/home/user/WebGrab".
You need read and write permissions for the folders and files in this 'homefolfer'.

Copy the following files and folders to this 'homefolder'
 
- WebGrab+Plus.exe
- WebGrab++.config.xml
- The siteini files
- mdb & rex folders
 
Execute:
 
First, you need to set the <filename> in WebGrab++.config.xml to a  complete linux path, like this:
 
<filename>/home/user/WebGrab/guide.xml</filename>

Do the same for <filename> and <ldbfilename> in mdb.config.xml and for  <filename> in rex.config.xml
 
Add or adjust the channellist in WebGrab++.config.xml and 
adjust the other settings of the config files if necessary. 
 
Then, enter in terminal mode: 
mono WebGrab+Plus.exe “complete_path_to_'homefolder'” like : 
mono WebGrab+Plus.exe “/home/user/WebGrab” 
 
That’s all...

(If you need delete the timezone on the guide.xml, on linux is easy, you can execute: 
sed 's/ +0200//g' guide.xml > guide_no_timezone.xml 
In this case, the timezone is +0200.)

Additional remarks concerning grabbing sincroguia with the Linux version:

A problem, with sincroguia, well, a problem with https urls on mono:

 Sometimes, the first time you run the sw you see this error:
 "Error #-2146762486: CERT_E_CHAINING 0x800B010A"
 or
 "Error downloading page: Error getting response stream (Write: The authentication or decryption has failed.): SendFailure"

 This is caused because mono don't trust the certificate authority. You need add this certificate to mono.
 To do this you need execute the command: (certmgr is a mono command)
 certmgr -add -c Trust "certificate.cer"

 More info: http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Security and http://pwet.fr/man/linux/commandes/certmgr

 In the sincroguia's case, you need to export the "GeoTrust Global CA" certificate as "DER binary codified X.509" from IE or Firefox.
 If you don't have this certificate, you can download from http://www.geotrust.com/resources/root-certificates/index.html , import to the web browser and then export it.
 After that, the program works well.
