WebGrab+Plus V1.0.9 --- Load Cookie:

If a site requires a login with username and stores your personal settings in a cookie, it is necessary to load this cookie into WG++ for it to send to this site as part of the WebRequest.

This is done by :

1. Ensure that your internet browser is set to accept cookies.
2. With your internet browser, navigate to the site and login with your username and password if the site requires that. Adapt the personal settings (like region and/or tv provider). It might be a good idea to refresh the page to check if all settings are correct. This also updates the cookie that the site stores on your computer.
3. Save the cookies to a file : In your internet browser there is an option to export cookies. (In IE8 or 9, File - Import and Export - Export to a File - Cookies). This file should be saved to the WebGrab+Plus homefolder C:\ProgramData\ServerCare\WebGrab and given an unique name (different from eventual other cookie files in this folder). A good choose for the cookie-file-name would be yourtv.com.au.cookie.txt (if the site for which it's needed is yourtv.com.au.)
4. Add (or change) the following entry in the siteini file for the site that needs this cookie file:
site {loadcookie=cookie-file-name}
5. The program attempts to correct eventual expired cookie entries. It will issue a warning if it did that. If despite this correction the effect of the cookie is not as usual renew the cookie file following 1. to 3.
6. More information in the documentation , section 4.3 (General Site Dependant data)
